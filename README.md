Example code for Pinoccio! (pinocc.io)

**Custom Bootstraps –** Upload a custom Bootstrap sketch to your Scout (via the Arduino IDE) to get it working with servos, [NeoPixels](http://www.adafruit.com/category/168), the [Capacitive Touch Backpack](http://support.pinocc.io/hc/en-us/articles/202311914-Capacitive-Touch), or a [NeuroSky MindFlex](http://www.hackster.io/glowascii/mesh-your-brain). Each comes with a description, a link to the required library, a bootstrap sketch, and an example ScoutScript project or two.

**Mini ScoutScript projects –** Mini-projects to help you learn about different ScoutScript functions, that you can adapt for your own projects.

**pinoccio-rest.html –** A simple HTML page created for [the Sneeze-Ray project](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Sneeze-Ray-Remote-Controlled-Nose-Tickler/?ALLSTEPS). The page includes a clickable image and a button, either of which will cause the Sneeze-Ray apparatus to administer a tickle to the wearer's nose.
