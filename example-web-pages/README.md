###Pinoccio Web Page Integration Examples

You may need to upload these to a server in order to get them to run. (For example, the light sensor reporting page won't get any data if you try to just run it from your computer.) If you have Dropbox, you can save the .html file to your Public folder, right-click and copy the public link, then open that URL in your browser.

The light sensor and temperature pages were created from Jake's Codepen examples, using [this method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tisD2jI1Tuc).

**display-temperature.html -** Reports a temperature reading in Fahrenheit, from the Pinoccio Scout's built-in temperature sensor. [See Fahrenheit & Celsius examples in our docs!](http://support.pinocc.io/hc/en-us/articles/201858360-Real-time-Temperature-Display-in-Javascript)

**light-sensor.html –** Reports a percentage reading from a [Pinoccio-connected light sensor circuit](http://support.pinocc.io/hc/en-us/articles/201858250-Real-time-Light-Sensor-in-Javascript).

**pinoccio-rest.html –** A simple HTML page created for [the Sneeze-Ray project](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Sneeze-Ray-Remote-Controlled-Nose-Tickler/?ALLSTEPS). The page includes a clickable image and a button, either of which will cause the Sneeze-Ray apparatus to administer a tickle to the wearer's nose.
